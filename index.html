    <p>
        Hi, my name is Sebastian.
    </p>
    <p>
        I live in Copenhagen and currently study at the Technical University of Denmark.
    </p>
    <p>
        I enjoy creating practical and applicable programs, whether it's so I can save a couple key strokes or
        create a
        program that solves a real world problem. I can comfortably work anywhere between high-level problem solving
        and
        low-level implementation and enjoy when something abstract gets a concrete use-case. Personally, I thrive
        in environments where there is space to learn and challenge myself in new and exciting ways.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of computer science, I like playing table top RPGs, working on cars and analogue photography.
        I find it important to disconnect from the constant stimulation from the internet and technology by getting
        fresh air and doing something practical.
    </p>
    <p>
        This page is my little corner of the internet, where I will share projects, ideas and learn more about web
        development
