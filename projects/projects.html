            I really enjoy playing tabletop RPGs, although I find they all suffer from one
            issue: the god damn combat rules. There is nothing worse than being in the
            zone, and then someone else says, "uhmm, actually, you can't do that." Now,
            some people really enjoy reading the rulebook front to back, but I really
            don't. It is just so much time for so little reward. There was only one
            solution to this problem: spend way more time than it would take reading the
            friendly manual learning a new programming paradigm, making a program to do it
            for me.

        <h6> Developed in C | 02-09-2025</h6>
        <p>Have you ever wondered how CDs can still play even when they get scratched? I
            certainly have, and when I was taking a course at university where we learned
            about error correcting codes, I knew that I wanted to build a decoder myself.
            What started out as an ambitious thought quickly turned into a week of intense
            programming and a couple of all-nighters.</p>
