        <p>
            I really enjoy playing tabletop RPGs, although I find they all suffer from one
            issue: the god damn combat rules. There is nothing worse than being in the
            zone, and then someone else says, "uhmm, actually, you can't do that." Now,
            some people really enjoy reading the rulebook front to back, but I really
            don't. It is just so much time for so little reward. There was only one
            solution to this problem: spend way more time than it would take reading the
            friendly manual learning a new programming paradigm, making a program to do it
            for me.
        </p>

        <p>I decided to create the CLI application in F#. I have been curious about
            functional languages for a while, but the specific language was picked partly
            for platform independence and partly since I would need to know it for some
            courses at university. I had now decided on my stack, I had decided on a
            project, I just needed to learn the basics of F#. Learning functional
            programming turned out to be a little more complicated than I previously
            thought. The implication of immutability hadn't really set in, and recursion
            was something I had only read about in books.</p>

        <p> Since the scope of this project was to learn functional programming and not
            create the most perfect DnD helper, I decided to limit the scope. Character
            creation was quickly thrown out the window — I barely understand it with pencil
            and paper. I realized that there are a million homebrewed ways of doing it and
            decided it would be too much to implement it in the application. My dungeon
            master enjoys magical plus-one weapons and sometimes creating something from
            scratch with custom stats. Although this is fun, it is hell for a universal
            application — meaning only one thing: out the window. The simple solution is to
            just have weapons as a JSON object and add them as we go along. </p>

        <p> So the plan was simple: make a simple application where I can go through my
            character's combat loop without forgetting how my character works. Simple,
            right? Wrong. Dungeons and Dragons is the most convoluted system of a billion
            conditions. If your dungeon master decides that your character has some form of
            natural advantage, you get what is aptly named “advantage,” meaning you roll to
            hit twice and pick the best one. There is also “disadvantage,” where you roll
            to hit twice and pick the worst. Not too bad, right? Don't worry, there is
            more. You can also have multi-hit abilities — if you roll a natural 20, you hit
            twice. All of these abilities combine and stack, leading to a logical mess. </p>

        <p> Dealing with the logical mess took some time and consulting with friends who
            know way more than me about DnD. After a while, I had the core logic down and
            could start implementing the logic. This is where functional programming really
            started to shine. I found it much easier to debug by reading the code. I rarely
            had a moment of "wait, how on earth did x become 5?" And recursion made a lot
            of sense for game combat loops.</p>

        <p> The program overall didn't take much more than a week to complete during my
            summer break. When it was all done, I was ready. My group would be impressed;
            they would cheer; they would hail me an engineering god. Then my dungeon master
            got too busy to prepare, so we decided to go on a hiatus of undefined length. </p>
